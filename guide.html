          I want to demonstrate the value of insider trading data in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html">EDGAR</a>, the SEC's corporate filings database. To do so, you will interact with a database that has been pre-populated with 1.1 million filings taken from EDGAR. In the next few slides you will:

          There's a graph theory that says that any person is at most six introductions away from meeting any other person on earth. This is the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation">"six degrees of separation"</a> and it holds true in many networks including this one.

          In graph theory, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon#Bacon_numbers">Bacon Path</a> (or Bacon Number) is the shortest distance between any two nodes in the network.
